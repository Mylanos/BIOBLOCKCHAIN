    abstract={The exponential growth in computing power, total Internet data throughput and human online interaction are the primary driving factors of the latest innovations in the field. Decentralized networks, disrupting the current centralized models, offer a unique potential to support societal fairness, information accessibility and security combined with business innovation. Blockchain technology is a pillar and leading concept within decentralized networks, serving as shared database across the network where information cannot be hampered with once stored and verified. Blockchain offers solutions to ever increasing security, verifiability and transparency concerns. It aims at cultivating a shared and trusted digital environment. Removing the single point of failure from the equation enables the technology to be applicable in industries where direct information flow and network security are priority concerns. The application of decentralized networks and blockchain has many possibilities and scenarios, what perhaps most stands out is optimization and increased trust of logistic value chains, quality control in the manufacturing stream, and transparency in maintenance model ranging from simple to sophisticated equipment.},

    ABSTRACT = {Since blockchain was introduced through Bitcoin, research has been ongoing to extend its applications to non-financial use cases. Healthcare is one industry in which blockchain is expected to have significant impacts. Research in this area is relatively new but growing rapidly; so, health informatics researchers and practitioners are always struggling to keep pace with research progress in this area. This paper reports on a systematic review of the ongoing research in the application of blockchain technology in healthcare. The research methodology is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and a systematic mapping study process, in which a well-designed search protocol is used to search four scientific databases, to identify, extract and analyze all relevant publications. The review shows that a number of studies have proposed different use cases for the application of blockchain in healthcare; however, there is a lack of adequate prototype implementations and studies to characterize the effectiveness of these proposed use cases. The review further highlights the state-of-the-art in the development of blockchain applications for healthcare, their limitations and the areas for future research. To this end, therefore, there is still the need for more research to better understand, characterize and evaluate the utility of blockchain in healthcare. },

    This chapter explores the past 40 years of development of biometrics from a U.S. perspective. Biometrics is defined as the automated recognition of living individuals, based on biological and behavioral traits. A quick overview of biometric history shows that much of what is consider to be “new” in biometrics was really considered decades ago. But even today, there is much left to be done. The most efficient route is to learn from history, focusing on the current efforts on what is yet unknown and not unknowingly rediscovering the developments of the past. It is much too early to speculate on what the first decade of the new millennium ultimately holds for biometrics. It seems clear, however, that the industry will continue to grow and that technical and human improvements to the systems will be made.}

	abstract = {Biometrics is the branch of science that deals with the identification and verification of an individual based on the physiological and behavioral traits. These traits or identifiers are permanent, unique and can separate one individual from another. Biometric recognition systems integrate complex definitional, technological and operational selection under various contexts. The systems are not going to replace the authentication tools and technologies, but the combination of biometric approaches and authentication methods to help in improving the security aspects of the applications where user cooperation can be inferred. Biometric based recognition methods and tools have become popular for the development of many useful, challenging and widely accepted applications such as security issues, surveillance, forensic investigations, fraudulent technologies, identity access management and access control. These systems also help to identify an individual in group of industrial networks, home/office building and control system. For the successful implementation of the biometric systems, deep artificial neural networks are in great demand. These systems can be built up either on the single modality or multiple modalities. This article explicates the comprehensive and deep survey that compactly and systematically summarizes the literature work done on unimodal and multimodal biometric systems and analyzes the feature extraction techniques, classifiers, datasets, results, efficiency and reliability of the system with high and multi-dimensional perspectives. This article also justifies in detail the classical methods, influential methods and taxonomy based on the biometric attributes. The goal is to aware the researchers of this area regarding various dimensions for the development of biometric systems to enhance the security aspects. The article begins with the fundamentals, types, need of system, challenges, uncertainties, motivations and then to the survey work. The tabular representation prepares for each biometric trait shows the author, year, major findings and results achieved with the synthesis analysis and the evaluation. The article finally ends up with the 3D biometric, a future perspective and concluding remarks.},

	abstract = {Biometric recognition, or simply Biometrics, is a rapidly evolving field with applications ranging from accessing one's computer to gaining entry into a country. Biometric systems rely on the use of physical or behavioral traits, such as fingerprints, face, voice and hand geometry, to establish the identity of an individual. The deployment of large-scale biometric systems in both commercial (e.g., grocery stores, amusement parks, airports) and government (e.g., US-VISIT) applications has served to increase the public's awareness of this technology. This rapid growth has also highlighted the challenges associated with designing and deploying biometric systems. Indeed, the problem of biometric recognition is a "Grand Challenge" in its own right. The past five years has seen a significant growth in biometric research resulting in the development of innovative sensors, robust and efficient algorithms for feature extraction and matching, enhanced test methodologies and novel applications. These advances have resulted in robust, accurate, secure and cost effective biometric systems. The Handbook of Biometrics -- an edited volume contributed by prominent invited researchers in Biometrics -- describes the fundamentals as well as the latest advancements in the burgeoning field of biometrics. It is designed for professionals composed of practitioners and researchers in Biometrics, Pattern Recognition and Computer Security. The Handbook of Biometrics can be used as a primary textbook for an undergraduate biometrics class. This book is also suitable as a secondary textbook or reference for advanced-level students in computer science.},

	abstract = {Biometric recognition offers a reliable solution to the problem of user authentication in identity management systems. With the widespread deployment of biometric systems in various applications, there are increasing concerns about the security and privacy of biometric technology. Public acceptance of biometrics technology will depend on the ability of system designers to demonstrate that these systems are robust, have low error rates, and are tamper proof. We present a high-level categorization of the various vulnerabilities of a biometric system and discuss countermeasures that have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities. In particular, we focus on biometric template security which is an important issue because, unlike passwords and tokens, compromised biometric templates cannot be revoked and reissued. Protecting the template is a challenging task due to intrauser variability in the acquired biometric traits. We present an overview of various biometric template protection schemes and discuss their advantages and limitations in terms of security, revocability, and impact on matching accuracy. A template protection scheme with provable security and acceptable recognition performance has thus far remained elusive. Development of such a scheme is crucial as biometric systems are beginning to proliferate into the core physical and information infrastructure of our society.},

Now, the number of users navigating through the Internet is more than 2.4 billion. This large audience demands online commerce, knowledge sharing, social networks etc., which grew exponentially over the past few years. Thus, it leads to the need for security and enhanced privacy. In recent days, fraud over the Internet constitutes one of the main drawbacks for the widespread of the use of commercial applications. Therefore, the three vital security issues take place every day in our world of transparent fashion, more precisely: identification, authentication and authorisation. Identification is a process that enables recognition of an entity, which may be either, a human, a machine, or another asset such as a software programme. In security systems, authentication and authorisation are two complementary mechanisms for determining who can access the information resources over a network. Many solutions have been proposed in the literature, from a simple password to recent technologies based on RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) or biometrics (Mahier et al., 2008).

We revise ﬁfteen years of research on decentralization and privacy, and provide an overview of key systems, as well as key insights for designers of future systems. We show that decentralized designs can enhance privacy, integrity, and availability but also require careful trade-oﬀs in terms of system complexity, properties provided, and degree of decentralization. These trade-oﬀs need to be understood and navigated by designers. We argue that a combination of insights from cryptography, distributed systems, and mechanism design, aligned with the development of adequate incentives, are necessary to build scalable and successful privacy-preserving decentralized systems.},

	abstract = {A blockchain is a distributed ledger for recording transactions, maintained by many nodes without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. All nodes validate the information to be appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in which entries are appended. Consensus protocols for tolerating Byzantine faults have received renewed attention because they also address blockchain systems. This work discusses the process of assessing and gaining confidence in the resilience of a consensus protocols exposed to faults and adversarial nodes. We advocate to follow the established practice in cryptography and computer security, relying on public reviews, detailed models, and formal proofs; the designers of several practical systems appear to be unaware of this. Moreover, we review the consensus protocols in some prominent permissioned blockchain platforms with respect to their fault models and resilience against attacks. The protocol comparison covers Hyperledger Fabric, Tendermint, Symbiont, R3{\textasciitilde}Corda, Iroha, Kadena, Chain, Quorum, MultiChain, Sawtooth Lake, Ripple, Stellar, and IOTA.},

Node identity authentication is an important means to ensure its security. Traditional IoT identity authentication protocols usually rely on trusted third parties. However, many IoT environments do not allow such conditions, and are prone to single point failure. Blockchain technology with decentralization features provides a new solution for distributed IoT system. In this paper, a blockchain based multi-WSN authentication scheme for IoT is proposed. The nodes of IoT are divided into base stations, cluster head nodes and ordinary nodes according to their capability differences, which are formed to a hierarchical network. A blockchain network is constructed among different types of nodes to form a hybrid blockchain model, including local chain and public chain. In this hybrid model, nodes identity mutual authentication in various communication scenarios is realized, ordinary node identity authentication operation is accomplished by local blockchain, and cluster head node identity authentication are realized in public blockchain. The analysis of security and performance shows that the scheme has comprehensive security and better performance.},

	abstract = {Our growing reliance on online services accessible on the Internet demands highly available systems that provide correct service without interruptions. Software bugs, operator mistakes, and malicious attacks are a major cause of service interruptions and they can cause arbitrary behavior, that is, Byzantine faults. This article describes a new replication algorithm, BFT, that can be used to build highly available systems that tolerate Byzantine faults. BFT can be used in practice to implement real services: it performs well, it is safe in asynchronous environments such as the Internet, it incorporates mechanisms to defend against Byzantine-faulty clients, and it recovers replicas proactively. The recovery mechanism allows the algorithm to tolerate any number of faults over the lifetime of the system provided fewer than 1/3 of the replicas become faulty within a small window of vulnerability. BFT has been implemented as a generic program library with a simple interface. We used the library to implement the first Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS file system, BFS. The BFT library and BFS perform well because the library incorporates several important optimizations, the most important of which is the use of symmetric cryptography to authenticate messages. The performance results show that BFS performs 2\% faster to 24\% slower than production implementations of the NFS protocol that are not replicated. This supports our claim that the BFT library can be used to build practical systems that tolerate Byzantine faults.},

Firstly, This paper proposes a credit model and voting mechanism, that the master node is generated by voting with nodes reputation values ,which ensures the reliability of the master node and reduces the possibility that the abnormal node acts as master node. Secondly, the consistency process is optimized to decrease the frequency and time of communication between nodes. Finally, the view switching protocol is optimized, that classification process for abnormal node and malicious node further reduces communication time. The experimental results show that compared with PBFT, IPBFT increases the average throughput, reduces the delay, and improves the operating efficiency and security of the system.},

In this paper, a blockchain hybrid consensus algorithm which combines advantages of the POS and PBFT algorithms is proposed, and the algorithm is divided into two stages: sortition and witness. The proposed algorithm reduces the number of consensus nodes to a constant value by verifiable pseudorandom sortition and performs transaction witness between nodes. The algorithm is improved and optimized from three dimensions: throughput, latency, and scalability. The experimental results show that the improved hybrid consensus algorithm is significantly superior to the previous single algorithms for its excellent scalability, high throughput, and low latency.},

	abstract = {The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed.},
