Welcome to Bioblockchain's documentation!
=========================================
This is a documentation webpage for the Bioblockchain demonstrator that showcases the integration of blockchain in biometric systems 
with the goal of making the system more secure. The demonstrator is a terminal application implemented in Python language, visualizing the communication
in the distributed network of nodes. These nodes are participating in a byzantine consensus that validates executed processes in a single node among more 
nodes thus resulting in the decentralization of the classical biometric system. Each operation outcome is stored in a blockchain data structure that extends the system's security. 
Blockchain characteristic immutability, transparency, and verifiability allow the nodes to verify previous transactions/operations, thus the proposed system can mitigate 
potential security weak points(such as overriding of the components, replay of old/artifical data, etc..).
